  `git rebase --continue` to finish the rebase  
  Finally the conflicts have been resolved and we can push our commit.  
  `git push origin`

# How to check if a script like foo.sh is executable and how to make it executable in Git?  
  `git ls-files --stage`  
  100644 6643f02815ab62179560af03520b32117a6f6e00 0       foo.sh  
  The attribute '100644' means the file is not executable, '**100755**' represents executable  

  `git update-index --chmod=+x foo.sh` will change that attribute to '100755'  
  `git ls-files --stage`  
  100755 6643f02815ab62179560af03520b32117a6f6e00 0       foo.sh

# How to load your ssh private key to 'ssh agent' when you open the git bash?  
After [adding your ssh public key to github](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account), you still need to load your private key into the 'ssh agent' in your local machine so that the ssh connection will be established successfully.   
Create a file named '.bash_profile' in your home folder so that the ssh private key will be loaded when you open a git bash.
  ```bash
    #!/bin/bash
  
    if ps --process $SSH_AGENT_PID > /dev/null
    then
    	echo "ssh-agent is already running"
    	# Do something knowing the pid exists, i.e. the process with $PID is running
    else
    	echo "starting ssh agent ..."
    	eval `ssh-agent -s`
    fi
    
    if ps --process $SSH_AGENT_PID > /dev/null
    then
    	echo "ssh agent process SSH_AGENT_PID=$SSH_AGENT_PID is running ... "
    	echo "add ssh keys to the agent ... "
    	ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_user1
    	ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_user2
    else
    	echo "no ssh agent, problem ..."
    fi
  ```
