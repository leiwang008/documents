On Windows 10, we can see the machine itself in the "network", but we cannot see the ohter machines (like windows xp) in the same group "mshome".

+ Open the "control panel"
+ Chose the "program and fonction" (程序和功能)
+ Chose "启用或关闭Windows功能"
+ Tick the option "SMB 1.0/CIFS 文件共享支持"
+ restart the machine

Now, you should be able to see the other machine in the same group "mshome", and you should be able to see the shared folders.
