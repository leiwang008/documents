If you come from the Java world, then it will be a little hard to understand python code. But if you come from javascript or go world, then it is super easy, they are very similar. Unfortunately I come from the Java world! Fortunately I have a chance to catch with python, go, fastapi, react, nextjs etc.

# asyncio.create_task(public_server.serve()) will the task() start immediately?
Yes, calling asyncio.**create_task**(public_server.serve()) will immediately schedule the coroutine public_server.serve() as a background task. However, it won't start executing right away—it will start running as soon as the event loop has an opportunity to process it.

🔍 How it Works
+ asyncio.create_task(coro) schedules coro to run concurrently with other tasks.
+ The event loop will pick it up and start running it as soon as possible (depending on other tasks in the loop).
+ If the current execution flow is blocking (i.e., waiting on something synchronous), public_server.serve() won’t start until control returns to the event loop.
🛠 Example Behavior
```python
import asyncio

async def task():
    print("Task started")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    print("Task finished")

async def main():
    print("Main started")
    asyncio.create_task(task())  # Task is scheduled immediately
    print("Main continues running")
    await asyncio.sleep(3)  # Keeps event loop alive
    print("Main finished")

asyncio.run(main())
```

Expected Output:
```shell
Main started
Main continues running
Task started
Task finished
Main finished
```
task() starts after asyncio.create_task(task()) is called.
main() does not wait for task() to finish before continuing.
The event loop keeps running because of await asyncio.sleep(3), allowing task() to complete.

🚨 Common Pitfall
If you don’t keep the event loop alive, the program may exit before the task runs:

asyncio.create_task(task())  # 🚨 This alone won't keep the loop alive!
Solution: Always ensure there's something awaited to keep the loop running.

# await asyncio.gather(*tasks) what gather will do?
asyncio.**gather**() runs multiple asynchronous tasks concurrently and collects their results when all are finished.

🛠 How It Works
+ It starts all the provided coroutines immediately.
+ It waits for all tasks to complete.
+ It returns a list of results (in the same order as the input tasks).
📌 Example Usage
```python
import asyncio

async def task(n):
    await asyncio.sleep(n)
    return f"Task {n} done"

async def main():
    tasks = [task(2), task(1), task(3)]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    print(results)

asyncio.run(main())
```

⏳ Expected Output (after ~3 seconds):
```shell
['Task 2 done', 'Task 1 done', 'Task 3 done']
```

All tasks start at the same time.
task(1) completes first, but gather() keeps waiting for all tasks.
The result order matches the input order, not the completion order.

⚡ When to Use gather()

✅ Running multiple independent async tasks at the same time

✅ Collecting all results after execution

✅ Ensuring all tasks run to completion

🚨 Beware of Exceptions
If any task raises an exception, gather() stops immediately and raises the first exception.

Handling Errors Gracefully:

```python
asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
```
This makes gather() return exceptions instead of raising them, so execution continues.

🔄 Alternative: asyncio.create_task()
If you don't need to wait for results immediately, use asyncio.create_task() instead:

```python
tasks = [asyncio.create_task(task(n)) for n in range(3)]
await asyncio.sleep(3)  # Keeps the event loop running
```


# This makes gather() return exceptions instead of raising them, so execution continues. what this mean? return exceptions?
When you use asyncio.gather() with **return_exceptions=True**, it does not raise exceptions immediately. Instead, it returns exceptions as part of the results list. This allows execution to continue even if some tasks fail.

📌 Example Without return_exceptions=True
```python
import asyncio

async def task(n):
    if n == 2:
        raise ValueError("Something went wrong!")  # This will cause an error
    await asyncio.sleep(n)
    return f"Task {n} done"

async def main():
    tasks = [task(1), task(2), task(3)]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)  # No `return_exceptions=True`

asyncio.run(main())
```
🔴 Output (Exception Raised, Program Stops)

```shell
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "script.py", line 12, in main
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
ValueError: Something went wrong!
```
The error in task(2) stops execution immediately.
We never get results for task(1) or task(3).

📌 Example With return_exceptions=True
```python
async def main():
    tasks = [task(1), task(2), task(3)]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
    print(results)  # The exception will be part of the results list

asyncio.run(main())
```

✅ Output (No Crash, Execution Continues)
```shell
['Task 1 done', ValueError('Something went wrong!'), 'Task 3 done']
```
Instead of stopping, gather() returns the exception as a result.
The order remains the same: "Task 1 done", then the ValueError, then "Task 3 done".
This lets you handle the exception manually later instead of crashing.
⚡ Why Use return_exceptions=True?

✅ When you don't want one failing task to break everything

✅ When you want to log errors and continue execution

✅ When you need all possible results, even if some tasks fail
